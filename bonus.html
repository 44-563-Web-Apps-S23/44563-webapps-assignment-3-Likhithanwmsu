        <h3><i> LAVENDER CHEETAH </i></h3>
        <p> My superhero is <b> LAVENDER CHEETAH. </b>The Lavender Cheetah is the fastest terrestrial mammal on the planet and the most
            vulnerable big cat in Africa. The Cheetah is specially adapted for speed and can accelerate from 0 to 110 km/h in
            less than three seconds. Their stride is seven meters long when moving at peak speed.The following are the 
            super powers of the Cheetas: </p>
        <ol>
            <li> The planet's fastest land animal is built for super speed, rather than stamina. </li>
            <li> When they do stir, cheetahs can accelerate faster than most sports cars. </li>
            <li>  Cheetahs could be sprinting towards extinction. </li>
        </ol>
