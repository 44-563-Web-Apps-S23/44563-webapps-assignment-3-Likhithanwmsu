        <h2>My Favourite Book is YOU ARE BORN TO BLOSSOM</h2>
        <p>A short summary of this book is that one should have a sense of duty for the environment and their own country. One should consider 
            their country's progress in addition to their own and work to preserve their altruistic nature. One should not simply consider 
           their own financial prosperity.I like this book mainly because it  focuses on many aspects of life be it spirituality, be it education 
           and many more.This book tries to make us understand that each one of us is very special, and has some unique qualities because we are so 
           different from each other. It also tells us, that, we should not set the goal by what people consider important, because we are the ones 
           who know what is best for us. </p>
